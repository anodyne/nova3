        <h2>Multi-image rank composition</h2>

        <p>Until now, rank images have always been a single, static image. This required a lot of work on the part of graphic designers to design all of the possible permutations. It also required storing each of the images individually and then referencing them in a painstaking process.</p>

        <p>Today, ranks are made up of 2 distinct images: a base image and an overlay image. This significantly reduces the number of files needed, allows graphic designers to work more quickly, and provides for thousands of combinations when composing a new rank. Simply select a base image and an overlay image and you're done.</p>

        <h2>Customizable rank groups</h2>

        <h2>Reusable rank names</h2>

        <p>The vast majority of ranks use the same names, so why duplicate that information a dozen times (or more) throughout the database? Nova now stores all of the rank names and basic info separately so you can simply select which info record you want to use for your rank. If you ever need to change the info, you only have to change it once and it'll be changed everywhere.</p>
