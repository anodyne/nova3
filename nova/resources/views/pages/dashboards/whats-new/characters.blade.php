        <h2>New character classifications</h2>

        <p>In the past, characters have been categorized in ways that don't necessarily reflect how they're used. There's can also be a lot of confusion around what an NPC is or how a character is classified as a protected NPC. Our goal was to eliminate that confusion and make things much clearer in Nova with an updated classification system for characters:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><x-badge color="primary">primary</x-badge></dt>
            <dd class="italic ml-1 mt-1">A character that is assigned to one or more users, and is marked as a primary character of one or more of those users.</dd>

            <dt class="mt-6"><x-badge color="info">secondary</x-badge></dt>
            <dd class="italic ml-1 mt-1">A character that is assigned to one or more users, but is not marked as a primary character of any of those users.</dd>

            <dt class="mt-6"><x-badge color="gray">support</x-badge></dt>
            <dd class="italic ml-1 mt-1">A character that is not assigned to any users.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Multi-user ownership</h2>

        <h2>Granular character creation controls</h2>

        <p>Game Masters now have more control over what players can do when it comes to creating characters.
