Nova NextGen has unique requirements that require a very particular file structure and setup. Out of the box, Laravel 5 doesn't support these requirements and many changes have been made to ensure Nova NextGen works the way we intend it to. This file describes the changes that have been made to this instance of Laravel 5 to make it work like we want.
